## Super Swag Schedule Scheduler
### built by team CATSK in 24 hours from Janurary 18th - 19th for QuackHacks Winter 2025

Have you ever been frustrated trying to schedule a meeting time among your fellow UO students? With CATSK's Super Swag Schedule Scheduler, fret no more.

This site takes an uploaded student schedule in html format and compares it against the schedules of other uploaded student schedules to identify free time slots shared between all schedules. This is helpful for planning times to meet up. We save you the endless back-and-forth to pick a meeting time so you can focus on the important things, such as what you'll be having for dinner.
