### built by team CATSK in 24 hours from Janurary 18th - 19th for QuackHacks Winter 2025

Have you ever been frustrated trying to schedule a meeting time among your fellow UO students? With CATSK's Super Swag Schedule Scheduler, fret no more.

Using the "Choose File" button, select multiple student schedules from Duckweb and upload using the "Upload" button.  The Super Swag Schedule Scheduler will compare them against each other to identify and display free time slots shared between all schedules. Now you can pick a meetup time. We save you the endless back-and-forth to pick a meeting time so you can focus on the important things, such as what you'll be having for dinner.
